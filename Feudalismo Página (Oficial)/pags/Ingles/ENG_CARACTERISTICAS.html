  <font face="cambria" size="3"><p align="center">Some characteristics from this period were: </p>
  <p>
      <li type= disc>The possession of large territories</ul>
      <li type= disc>The servants are in charge of working on earth</ul>
      <li type= disc>The preferred activity was agriculture</ul>
      <li type= disc>Rural life is organized and controlled by the feudal lords</ul>
      <li type= disc>During the feudal period the economy was autarkic, that is to say, it was produced
       only what is necessary for the consumption of the fief</ul>
      <li type= disc>The basis of wealth is the property of the land, since it was richer who had more land, since the production base was agriculture</ul>
      <h2>1. SOCIAL CLASSES</h2>
    <p>The society was divided into three well-differentiated strata:</p>
    <li type= disc>Nobility: The members of the nobility, owners of large tracts of land, generally received in payment to their military efforts </ul>
      <li type= disc>Clergy: dealt with matters Religious, which by then dominated the general human behavior</ul>
        <li type= disc>Serfs: lower stratum and responsible for cultivating the lands and making them produce.Above all of them was the king.<ul>
          <p>Above all of them was the king</p>
          <audio src="../../multimedia/carlomagno.mp3" preload="none" controls></audio>
          <h2>2. CASTLES AND FORTS</h2>
          <p>To be able to have control over the works of the servants, but more than anything to be alert against possible attacks of enemies,
            during the feudalism were built in Europe a lot of castles.</p>
    <p>  It was typical that these castles-fortifications had double a wall (an exterior and an interior), and one or several towers, with
      interior patios and sometimes a peripheral moat. The castle was the base of military operations, as well as housing.</p>
    <h2>3. ECONOMY</h2>
    <p>The generation of wealth basically came from agriculture and animal husbandry, by the servants of the gleba. In feudal society there
      was still no trade or industry, it was not a monetized system.</p>
    <h2>4. PAYMENT OF TAXES</h2>
    <p>The servants were to pay "in kind" (sacks of grain, wine casks, jars of oil, breeding animals) the right to live in these lands,
      and the vassals, in turn, should pay large income, also generally in kind. These rents can be considered tributes. Another kind of
      tribute was tithing, originally a contribution to guarantee the maintenance of the clergy.</p>
    <h2>5. CLOSED SYSTEM</h2>
    <p> feudalism was a closed economic and social system, with no possibility of class mobility (who was born servant would die servant).
      Since the main supporter of the feudal system was the need to protect each other in a time of continuous invasions for the conquest
      of lands, once those became less frequent, many stopped feeling the need to be under the protection of a Feudal lord.</p>
    <p>The ' Burgos ' were gradually emerging, small villages where artisans and traders practiced a free economy. And so the feudal
      system was yielding its place, allowing the birth of a new concept: that of the bourgeoisie.</p>
